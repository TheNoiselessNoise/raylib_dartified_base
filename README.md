# raylib_dartified_base

Platform interface package for the `raylib_dartified` package family.

Defines the shared API surface (types, structs, abstract flat-call
modules) that platform implementations bind to. This package is **not**
fully backend-agnostic: it defines primitives a platform must supply
itself, since pointer representation and native call dispatch differ
between native (`dart:ffi`) and WebAssembly (linear memory).

## For platform implementors

A platform implementation must provide:

- `RaylibBase` => platform specific `Raylib` class implementation
- `MemoryPointer<X extends RType>` => pointer abstraction backed by whatever memory
  model the platform uses (FFI pointer vs. WASM linear memory offset).
- A concrete flat module for each of the following, extending the
  matching abstract type defined here and exposed via `RaylibBase`:

  | Extension | Abstract type |
  |---|---|
  | Matrix ext. | `RaylibMatrixFlatExt<R>` |
  | Quaternion ext. | `RaylibQuaternionFlatExt<R>` |
  | Vector2 ext. | `RaylibVector2FlatExt<R>` |
  | Vector3 ext. | `RaylibVector3FlatExt<R>` |
  | Vector4 ext. | `RaylibVector4FlatExt<R>` |

  | Module | Abstract type |
  |---|---|
  | Audio | `RaylibAudioFlat<R>` |
  | Camera | `RaylibCameraFlat<R>` |
  | Core | `RaylibCoreFlat<R>` |
  | Gui | `RaylibGuiFlat<R>` |
  | Light | `RaylibLightFlat<R>` |
  | MsfGif | `RaylibMsfGifFlat<R>` |
  | Rlgl | `RaylibRlglFlat<R>` |
